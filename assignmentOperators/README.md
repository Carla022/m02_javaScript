# Arithmetic Operators - Bank Account Balance

## Problem

<p>
You want to withdraw some money from your bank account.

Make the program take two numbers as input (your account balance and the amount you want to withdraw) and assign them to corresponding "balance" and "withdraw" variables.
Calculate and output the remaining balance after the withdrawal.
